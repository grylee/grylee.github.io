				We study the molecular and cellular mechanisms shaping genome variation, which is the ultimate determinant of the myriad diversity of life and our health.
				Our current work focuses on a substantial component of most eukaryotic genomes, <b>"transposable elements"</b> (TEs), which copy
				themselves and move to new genomic locations. We aim to understand how these widespread and variable "genomic parasites" shape 
				the evolution of genomes through altering chromatin landscapes. 
				To achieve this, we use Drosophila (fruit flies hovering over fruits!!) as a model system,
				and integrate population genomics, epigenomics, computational biology, and cell biology.</br></br>


				In addition to TEs, we investgiate the variation of chromatin landscapes within and between species and identify the
				functional causes and evolutionary consequences of such variation. </br></br>

							<h2>Epigenetic effects of transposable elements along linear chromosomes</h2>
						</a>
						<p>Various eukaryotes have evolved ways to “mark” TE sequences with repressive epigenetic marks,
							which reduce the ability of TEs to move and to multiply.
							However, we and others discovered that these repressive epigenetic marks at TEs
							inadvertently “spread” to neighboring genes
							along the linear chromosome in insects, plants, and mammals.
							Our recent results further revealed that this phenomenon (<b>“epigenetic effects of
								TEs”</b>) is prevalent across the Drosophila genomes,
							interferes with gene function, and impairs organismal fitness. In other words, TEs are
							deleterious because of host silencing mechanisms
							evolved to reduce TEs’ harmful effects.
							We are investigating why organisms failed to curb these harmful side effects and studying
							the associated functional consequences on the evolution of both eukaryotic genomes and TEs.

							<h2>Epigenetic effects of transposable elements in 3D nuclear space</h2>
						</a>
						<p>In addition to exerting epigenetic effects along the linear chromosomes,
							we found that epigenetically silenced TEs can have epigenetic effects <b>in 3D nuclear
								space</b>.
							By combining functional genomics and cytology, we discovered that TEs interact with distant
							“dark matter” of the genome (“heterochromatin”)
							through “liquid-liquid phase separation” (just like the separation of oil and vinegar in
							salad dressing!).
							These spatial interactions can mislocalize genomic regions in 3D nuclear space,
							altering genome organization.
							We are investigating how TE-mediated nuclear reposition of various genomic regions
							influences cellular functions,
							and how this shapes genome evolution. </p>

							<h2>Population genomics of transposable elements</h2>
						</a>
						<p>While TEs have been found in virtually all eukaryotic genomes surveyed,
							there is substantial variation in their abundance, composition, and genomic positions within
							and between species.
							For instance, TEs occupy less than 1% of the honeybee genome,
							but ~45% of the human genome and more than 85% of some plant genomes.
							Using comparative population genomics and theoretical modeling,
							we are investigating the evolutionary forces driving this
							remarkable difference in TEs’ evolutionary dynamics between species 
							using both comparative functional genomics and theoretical modeling. </p>

							<h2>Roles of chromatin landscape in shaping genome evolution</h2>
						</a>
						<p>Chromatin modifications (either at DNA or at histones wrapped by DNA) could influence fundamental cellular processes, including
							transcription, DNA repair, and, of course, regulations of our favorite genetic elements, TEs. 
							Our recent studies reveal that the chromatin landscape is quite variable between even closely related species. 
							We are investigating how such variation contributes to differing cellular processes and thus genome evolution. 
							We also aim to unearth how and why the chromatin landscapes differ between species at the first place. </p>
